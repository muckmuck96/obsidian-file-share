</div>

---

## Summary

Enables **end-to-end encrypted file sharing** via socket server, to directly share some obsidian files from one vault to another. Just exchange a key with your friends and save this into your friendlist and you are good to go...

## Showcases

## Configuration

As a default socket server, there is one running by us (hosted in germany). But you are able to configure your own socket server, which can be deployed easily via our socket-server docker image or you just run it directly on a machine of your choice. Just look at: https://github.com/muckmuck96/obsidian-file-share-server
